      <description>Abstract This research presents a security flaw in a Bank&amp;rsquo;s mobile application (both iOS and Android). The flaw enables one to verify if a user has registered on the mobile application, reset a user&amp;rsquo;s password, change a user&amp;rsquo;s pin code, bypass OTP for payment authorisation, reset a user&amp;rsquo;s password using the customer&amp;rsquo;s email and a temporary userid, change a user&amp;rsquo;s pin code using the actual userid and phantom keys, bypass bank-to-momo transaction fees, generate cardless tokens for third-paties without code validation, set a new pin in the mobile application without validating the old pin and also perform a purchase of airtime using a valid customer&amp;rsquo;s userid and phantom keys without transaction code verification.</description>

      <description>Abstract GhanaPostGPS is Ghana&amp;rsquo;s official digital addressing system which ensures that all locations in the country are addressed. Each location has a unique address which is a composite of the postcode (region, district &amp;amp; area code). Its core functionality is to translate a user&amp;rsquo;s GPS location coordinates to a user-friendly digital address. Those who developed the addressing system did not make available a public application programming interface (API) that can be used by local developers in building technological solutions.</description>

      <guid>/post/2020/06/a-security-analysis-of-whatsapp-ios-mobile-application/</guid>
      <description>Abstract This research presents an investigation into WhatsApp&amp;rsquo;s on-device data storage on iOS. WhatsApp is one of the most widely used messaging application and hence it is required that a secured on-device storage mechanism be implemented to complement Apple&amp;rsquo;s security measures for their devices. This will help protect a user&amp;rsquo;s data in instances where his/her device is compromised physically. The research presents a security analysis on the storage format of data used by WhatsApp on end-users&#39; devices.</description>
