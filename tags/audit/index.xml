      <description>Abstract This research presents a security flaw in a Bank&amp;rsquo;s mobile application (both iOS and Android). The flaw enables one to verify if a user has registered on the mobile application, reset a user&amp;rsquo;s password, change a user&amp;rsquo;s pin code, bypass OTP for payment authorisation, reset a user&amp;rsquo;s password using the customer&amp;rsquo;s email and a temporary userid, change a user&amp;rsquo;s pin code using the actual userid and phantom keys, bypass bank-to-momo transaction fees, generate cardless tokens for third-paties without code validation, set a new pin in the mobile application without validating the old pin and also perform a purchase of airtime using a valid customer&amp;rsquo;s userid and phantom keys without transaction code verification.</description>

      <guid>/post/2020/11/unauthorised-user-account-access-on-irokotv-platform/</guid>
      <description>Abstract This research presents a flaw in user authentication that enables an unauthorised user to enumerate valid user accounts on the iRokoTV client applications (mobile and web) and also crack a personâ€™s pin code. The security analysis was done on the iOS platform; the flaw translates to other platforms (android and web).
Details of the Flaw The iRokoTV iOS application (version 1.7.12) presents a user with the option to sign up or log in as an existing user.</description>

      <description>Abstract GhanaPostGPS is Ghana&amp;rsquo;s official digital addressing system which ensures that all locations in the country are addressed. Each location has a unique address which is a composite of the postcode (region, district &amp;amp; area code). Its core functionality is to translate a user&amp;rsquo;s GPS location coordinates to a user-friendly digital address. Those who developed the addressing system did not make available a public application programming interface (API) that can be used by local developers in building technological solutions.</description>

      <link>/post/2020/06/a-security-analysis-of-whatsapp-ios-mobile-application/</link>

      <guid>/post/2020/06/a-security-analysis-of-whatsapp-ios-mobile-application/</guid>
      <description>Abstract This research presents an investigation into WhatsApp&amp;rsquo;s on-device data storage on iOS. WhatsApp is one of the most widely used messaging application and hence it is required that a secured on-device storage mechanism be implemented to complement Apple&amp;rsquo;s security measures for their devices. This will help protect a user&amp;rsquo;s data in instances where his/her device is compromised physically. The research presents a security analysis on the storage format of data used by WhatsApp on end-users&#39; devices.</description>

      <title>Security Flaw in the KNUST AIM Application</title>
      <link>/post/2019/09/security-flaw-in-the-knust-aim-application/</link>

      <guid>/post/2019/09/security-flaw-in-the-knust-aim-application/</guid>
      <description>Abstract The Academic Information Manager (AIM) is the official mobile application for KNUST students. The key functions of AIM include: course registration, checking of results, editing of personal records, access to news from the University&amp;rsquo;s website, notifications and checking of fees. This research presents a flaw in the bearer authorization token implementation in the REST API for the AIM app. This authorization token is not validated per user basis, hence can be exploited to access or modify any student&amp;rsquo;s information through the REST API.</description>
